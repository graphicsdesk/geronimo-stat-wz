There are three stats that contribute to the usage rate—points, assists, and turnovers. For a starting lineup of a basketball team, which consists of five players, a typical usage rate would be split equally among them. Rubio De La Rosa’s usage rate each season has been relatively average—right around 22 percent—but has continually increased over his career, peaking at 24.9 percent this season. Therefore, despite his turnover numbers going down, he has become more involved offensively and more efficient at protecting the ball."

Instead of passing the ball off on his touch, as he tended to do in previous seasons, now Rubio De La Rosa often takes the ball and scores, marking a development of his scoring instinct."
